# PySimio
**PySimio** is a Python library for discrete-event simulation. You can simulate multiple agents (vehicles, entities) in a non-deterministic system. We support muilti-core processing to speed up experiments.

## Features
- Object-Oriented Simulation
- Animation
- Commandline Debugging
- Statistic Collection and Data Visualization 
- Multicore Processing

## Setup
PySimio is built with following libraries:
- numpy 
- pandas 
- seaborn, matplotlib 
- pygame
All of the above packages can be installed through the package management system pip as below:
```
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib pygame
```

We highly recommend using **Python 3.6.1** or greater.
We also discovered the issue that pygame fails to render properly with Mac retina display [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29834292/pygame-simple-loop-runs-very-slowly-on-mac)
